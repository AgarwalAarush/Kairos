# Todo List Application - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Build a modern todo list web application using Next.js 14+ with App Router and Supabase backend, featuring Google authentication, smart parsing, and advanced organization features.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Critical Path) âœ…
- [x] **Next.js 14+ Project Setup**
  - [x] Initialize with App Router
  - [x] Configure TypeScript
  - [x] Set up Tailwind CSS
  - [x] Install and configure shadcn/ui components
  - [x] Create basic project structure and routing

---

## Phase 2: Authentication & Database (High Priority) âœ…
- [x] **Supabase Integration**
  - [x] Create Supabase project
  - [x] Configure Google OAuth authentication
  - [x] Set up environment variables and configuration

- [x] **Database Schema Creation**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE todos (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    tags TEXT[],
    project TEXT,
    priority INTEGER CHECK (priority IN (1,2,3)),
    due_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
    work_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
    completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  ```

- [x] **Authentication Flow**
  - [x] Protected routes and middleware
  - [x] Login/logout functionality
  - [x] Session management

---

## Phase 3: Core Todo CRUD (MVP) âœ…
- [x] **Basic Todo Operations**
  - [x] TypeScript interfaces and types
  - [x] Create todo with simple form
  - [x] Display todos in list view
  - [x] Edit todo functionality (inline or modal)
  - [x] Delete todo
  - [x] Toggle completion status
  - [x] Mobile-responsive basic layout

---

## Phase 4: Smart Parsing & Organization (Medium-High Priority) âœ…
- [x] **Intelligent Text Parsing**
  - [x] Parse #hashtags for tags
  - [x] Parse @projects for project assignment
  - [x] Parse priority indicators (!, !!, !!!)
  - [x] Auto-extract and save to appropriate fields

- [x] **Organization Features**
  - [x] Tag management and display
  - [x] Project management and display
  - [x] Basic filtering by tags, projects, completion status

---

## Phase 5: Date Management (Medium Priority) âœ…
- [x] **Date Functionality**
  - [x] Due date picker integration
  - [x] Work date picker integration
  - [x] Date-based filtering and sorting
  - [x] Overdue highlighting

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Medium Priority) ðŸ”„
- [x] **Enhanced Filtering & Search**
  - [x] Advanced multi-criteria filtering
  - [x] Full-text search across todos, tags, projects
  - [x] Multiple sorting options (priority, dates, alphabetical)

- [ ] **Multiple View Modes**
  - [ ] List view (default)
  - [ ] Card view
  - [ ] Kanban-style boards
  - [ ] View persistence

- [x] **Bulk Operations**
  - [x] Multi-select functionality
  - [x] Bulk delete, complete, tag assignment

---

## Phase 7: UX Polish & Interactions (Lower Priority) âœ…
- [x] **Visual Polish**
  - [x] Dark/light mode toggle with specified color schemes
  - [x] Smooth animations and transitions
  - [x] Loading states throughout app
  - [x] Toast notifications for actions

- [x] **Advanced Interactions**
  - [ ] Drag and drop reordering
  - [x] Keyboard shortcuts (Enter, Escape, etc.)
  - [ ] Auto-save functionality
  - [ ] Responsive design refinements

---

## Phase 8: Production Ready (Lowest Priority)
- [ ] **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
  - [ ] Comprehensive error handling
  - [ ] Network failure recovery
  - [ ] Form validation and user feedback

- [ ] **Performance & Deployment**
  - [ ] Performance optimizations
  - [ ] SEO metadata
  - [ ] Deployment configuration
  - [ ] Optional: Testing setup

---

## Key Dependencies & Rationale

- **Foundation â†’ Auth**: Need Next.js setup before integrating Supabase
- **Auth â†’ CRUD**: Need user authentication for data persistence  
- **CRUD â†’ Smart Parsing**: Need basic todo operations before adding intelligent features
- **Smart Parsing â†’ Advanced Features**: Organization system must work before complex filtering
- **Core Features â†’ Polish**: Get functionality working before adding animations

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 3 Complete**: Users can create, read, update, delete todos
- **Phase 4 Complete**: Smart parsing works for tags, projects, priorities
- **Phase 6 Complete**: Full-featured todo application with advanced filtering
- **Phase 7 Complete**: Polished, production-ready application

*This plan delivers value incrementally - users get a working todo app after Phase 3, with each subsequent phase adding significant functionality.*
